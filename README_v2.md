# Konnect Dev Portal Ops CLI <!-- omit in toc -->

A rather opinionated CLI tool for managing API products on **Konnect Developer Portals**.

The tool is designed to perform various operations, such as publishing, deprecating, unpublishing, or deleting API products and their versions based on OpenAPI Specification (OAS) files.

Ensure that the required Konnect Developer Portals are set up before using this tool.

> **Note:** The CLI is still under active development. Some features may not be fully supported yet. Use it responsibly and report any issues you encounter.

## Installation

1. Install the CLI using `pip`:

   ```shell
   $ pip install kptl
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a `yaml` config file to set the CLI configuration variables.  
   ```yaml
      # $HOME/.kptl.config.yaml
      konnect_url: https://us.api.konghq.com
      konnect_token: <your-konnect-token>
      http_proxy: http://proxy.example.com:8080 # Optional
      https_proxy: https://proxy.example.com:8080 # Optional
   ```

## Usage

```shell
$ kptl [command] [options]
```

### Available Commands

#### `sync`

Synchronize the predefined API Product state with Konnect Developer Portals using the `sync` command. 

This command uses API Product state files to determine the operations to perform on Konnect.

Example of a simple state file:

```yaml
# httpbin_state.yaml
_version: 1.0.0 # API Product Configuration file version
info:
   name: HTTPBin API # API Product name
   description: A simple API Product for requests to httpbin # API Product description
portals: # List of portals to publish the API Product to
   - name: dev_portal
   - name: prod_portal
versions: # List of API Product versions
   - name: "1.0.0" # API Product version name. Optional - defaults to the version in the OAS spec.
      spec: examples/api-specs/v1/httpbin.yaml # Path to the OAS spec file for the API Product version
      portals: # List of portals to publish the API Product version to
         - name: dev_portal   
         - name: prod_portal
   - name: "2.0.0"
      spec: examples/api-specs/v2/httpbin.yaml
      portals:
         - name: dev_portal
         - name: prod_portal
```

To sync the API Product state with Konnect, run:

```shell
$ kptl sync httpbin_state.yaml --config .config.yaml
```

This command will:
1. Ensure the API Product is created on Konnect.
2. Publish the API Product to the specified portals.
3. Create the API Product versions on Konnect.
4. Upload the defined API specifications to the respective API Product versions.
5. Publish the API Product versions to the specified portals.

    E --> F[Publish API Product Versions]
```

#### `delete`

Delete the API Product and its associations from Konnect using the `delete` command.

```shell
$ kptl delete product_name_or_id --config .config.yaml
```

to skip the interactive confirmation prompt, use the `--yes` flag:

```shell
$ kptl delete product_name_or_id --config .config.yaml --yes
```

### `explain`

Explain the API Product state file and the operations that will be performed on Konnect.

```shell
$ kptl explain httpbin_state.yaml
```

### Common Arguments

The CLI supports the following arguments:

| Option            | Required                         | Description                                                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--konnect-token` | **Yes** (if config file not set) | The Konnect token to use for authentication.                               |
| `--konnect-url`   | **Yes** (if config file not set) | The Konnect API server URL.                                                |
| `--config`        | No                               | Path to the CLI configuration file. Defaults to `$HOME/.kptl.config.yaml`. |
| `--http-proxy`    | No                               | HTTP proxy URL.                                                            |
| `--https-proxy`   | No                               | HTTPS proxy URL.                                                           |

### Advanced Usage

#### üö´ Unpublish API Product Versions

To unpublish an API Product version from a portal, update the state file to set the `publish_status` to `unpublished` for the desired portal.

```yaml
# httpbin_state.yaml
...
versions:
   - name: "1.0.0"
      spec: examples/api-specs/v1/httpbin.yaml
      portals:
         - name: dev_portal
            config:
               publish_status: unpublished
...
```

Then run the sync command:

```shell
$ kptl sync httpbin_state.yaml --config .config.yaml
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecate API Product Version from a Portal

To deprecate an API Product version from a portal, update the state file to set the `deprecated` to `true` for the desired portal.

```yaml
# httpbin_state.yaml
...
versions:
   - name: "1.0.0"
      spec: examples/api-specs/v1/httpbin.yaml
      portals:
         - name: dev_portal
            config:
               deprecated: true
...

```

Then run the sync command:

```shell
$ kptl sync httpbin_state.yaml --config .config.yaml
```

#### üîó Link Gateway Services to API Product versions

To link a Gateway Service to an API Product version, update the state file to include the `gateway_service` section with the appropriate `id` and `control_plane_id`.

```yaml
# httpbin_state.yaml
...
versions:
   - name: "1.0.0"
      spec: examples/api-specs/v1/httpbin.yaml
      gateway_service:
         id: <gateway-service-id>
         control_plane_id: <control-plane-id>
...
```

Then run the sync command:

```shell
$ kptl sync httpbin_state.yaml --config .config.yaml
```

#### üìö Managing API Products Documentation

How it works:
- All related API Product documents must be present in a directory.
- All `.md` files in the directory are considered documentation files.
- The ordering and inheritance of documents are based on the file name prefixes (ex: `1_,1.1_,1.2_,2_,3_,3.1_`).
- By default, all documents get published. If you want to unpublish a document, add the `__unpublished` tag at the end of the file name.
- Existing API Product documents that are not present in the documents folder will be deleted.

For an example documents folder structure and use-cases, see the [examples/products/httbin/docs](examples/products/httbin/docs) directory.

To sync the API Product documents with Konnect, update the state file to include the `documents` section with the `sync` flag set to `true` and the `dir` pointing to the documents directory.

```yaml
# httpbin_state.yaml
...
info: ...
documents:
   sync: true
   dir: examples/products/httpbin/docs
...
```

Then run the sync command:

```shell
$ kptl sync httpbin_state.yaml --config .config.yaml
```

## CLI Configuration

The CLI supports the following variables for configuration in a `yaml` file:  

| Variable        | Description                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `konnect_url`   | Konnect API server URL.                |
| `konnect_token` | Token for authenticating API requests. |
| `http_proxy`    | HTTP proxy URL.                        |
| `https_proxy`   | HTTPS proxy URL.                       |

And the following environment variables:

| Variable    | Description                                                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging verbosity level (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`). Default: `INFO`. |
